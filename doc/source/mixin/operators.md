### Observable extensions
#### Unsubscribe when
This operator unsubscribes from the source observable when `pauser$` emits a truthy value,
and re-subscribes when it emits a falsy value.


```js
export const unsubscribeWhen = pauser$ => (source) => {
  if (process.env.DEBUG && !pauser$) throw Error();
  return pauser$.pipe(switchMap(paused => (paused ? never() : source)));
};
```

#### Custom subscribe
A custom subscribe function that will `recover` from an error and log it to the console.
This is a line of last defense to make sure the entire pipeline/page doesn't crash.


```js
/*
function subscribe(ne, er, co) {
  let res = this;
  if (process.env.DEBUG) res = this.pipe(tap({ error: e => console.error(e) }));
  return res
    .pipe(catchError((e, c) => c))
    .subscribe(ne, er, co);
}
*/
```
